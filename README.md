An imitation e-commerce app that employs a custom-trained convolutional neural network (Yolov8) to detect assorted office supplies. Developed for DECA competition, model was trained with [a Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EdjeElectronics/Train-and-Deploy-YOLO-Models/blob/main/Train_YOLO_Models.ipynb) and UI was designed using Flutter and Dart.
